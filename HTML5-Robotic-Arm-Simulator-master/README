This is a Basic HTML5 Robotic Arm Simulator.

The only functionality that is currently offered is in "Joint Mode".

STEPS:

1: Press the 'Man/Halt' button until the Joint light is on
2: Select a Joint by pressing either the 'Y2', 'Z3' or 'RY5' buttons (only joints 2, 3, and 5 work since it's on a 2D canvas)
3: Use the Drive buttons (the ones with the + and - signs) to move the joints
4: The more you drink, the funner it gets
